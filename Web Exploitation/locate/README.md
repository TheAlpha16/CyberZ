## solution

On visiting the given link, we are greeted with this image

![buzz.jpg](./assets/buzz.jpg)

Now text on the image suggests that we need to find the path of the image. Checking the source, we can see that the path of the image is `./assets/buzz.jpg`.

So acccessing the directory `./assets/` reveals that there are two files `buzz.jpg` and `flag.html`

![assets.png](./assets/assets.png)

But the flag is not here. Inspecting the element reveals that there is one more directory `/real_assets/`

![real_assets]

Visiting the url `flag.html` will give the flag.
